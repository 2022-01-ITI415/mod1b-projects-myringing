# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

 My game is Battle City, which combines most of what I've learned from the previous three projects. Include: InputSystem in the first project, a Player that can be manipulated by the player. Camera following in the third project: mouse-controlled field of view movement. Spawn items in the second project. I'm not just porting a few features, I'm combining all of them into a fun game that will challenge players a bit. The difficulty of my game increases as the level progresses, and there is a big chance that the player will lose a few times to finally complete the game, so in a short time it won't bore the player.

My game has an easy to understand interaction system and there is a tutorial at the beginning of Battle City. It has all the available in-game keys and can be experimented with in the prep area.

In all Scences, the menu will be automatically called up at the end of the game, you can also use the ESC key on the keyboard to call up the menu at any time to choose to restart, return to the title or quit .

Happy gaming!
